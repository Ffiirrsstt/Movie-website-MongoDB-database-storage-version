# movie-website
The movie website developed using React, Python, FastAPI, PyMongo, MongoDB, and incorporating AI for sentiment analysis of reviews and a recommendation system for movies.

## Here's the breakdown of the scope for designing or developing the program:

1. **Account Registration System**: Includes the creation of accounts with username and password.
2. **Login System**: Users must log in to comment/review or view movie details.
3. **Comment/Review System**: Allows users to leave comments or reviews, with sentiment analysis categorizing them as positive or negative.
4. **Edit/Delete Comments/Reviews**: Users can modify or remove their comments/reviews.
5. **Data Storage**: User account details (with password encryption), movie details, comments, and reviews are stored.
6. **Recommendation System**: Upon logging in, the system recommends movies similar to those previously viewed.
7. **Popular Movies Display**: For users who haven't logged in or haven't viewed any movie details, popular movies are displayed based on viewer count.
8. **Logout System**: Users can log out, and upon logging back in, their comment/review and movie recommendation data remains.
9. **Comment/Review Management**:  Only account owners who have made the comments/reviews can edit or delete them.
10. **Filtering Comments/Reviews**: Users can filter comments/reviews by positive or negative sentiment.
11. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for movies, with an option to view logged-out movie results.
12. **Login Time Limitation**: After a set period, users cannot comment or view movie details until they log in again (this time limit can be adjusted in the code).
